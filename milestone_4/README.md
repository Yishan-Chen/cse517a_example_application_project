Milestone 4
===========

Folders
-------

Each milestone folder should include the following

* All code you wrote/used
* A README file

They should not include

* Datasets
* Large packages

README
------

The README file should include

We misunderstand the requirement of Milestone 4. We imply an ANN project which is one of the optional projects. There is the description of our ANN. Also we attach the result comparison of all the 4 appilcation projects and brief explanation.

Description of what your team did
* Implementation of ANN with 10-fold cross validation on MNIST dataset.

Methods used to accomplish each part
* First convert matrix data into vector. Then split the whole dataset into train, test and validation dataset. Convert the 
original data to dummy vector. Build a ANN with two fully connected hidden layers using Keras package. Choose sigmoid function as the active function. Make prediction, compare with true label and get the error rate.

Potential difficulties faced
* Hard to deal with muti-classification.

Resources used
* MNIST dataset, Sk-learn, pandas, matplotlib, Keras package.
